# Snake-Game
Python Snake Game - Implemented using Turtle graphics library. Control the snake, handle collisions, and manage score. Python, Turtle, OOP.

# Game Logic
- The snake starts with a single segment and moves continuously in the direction specified by the player.
- The player uses arrow keys to change the snake's direction: up, down, left, or right.
- The goal is to eat the food, represented by a green square, which makes the snake longer and increases the score.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- The player can restart the game after a collision.
- The game keeps track of the player's score.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language used to develop the game.
- Turtle: Graphics library for drawing game elements.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Game components organized into classes for modularity.
- Event Handling: Player input captured through keyboard events.
- Collision Detection: Logic for detecting collisions with walls, food, and the snake itself.

# How to Play
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Run python main.py to start the game.
- Control the snake's direction using the arrow keys: up, down, left, right.
- Eat food to grow the snake and score points.
- Avoid collisions with the wall or the snake's own body.
